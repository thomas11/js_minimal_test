js-minimal-test
===============

The most minimal JavaScript unit test framework I could come up
with. This is not for browser testing, it's for stand-alone
JavaScript!

31 lines of code are enough for tests with names, grouped into
functions according to your liking, and supporting testing exceptions.
Not enough for recording the reason of test failures or nesting tests.
But JavaScript makes it trivial to share context between your test
functions.

See examples/ for just that.


Background
==========

I plan to make several versions that get successively bigger and
introduce more features, to get a feel for the behind-the-scenes of
testing, and to find the sweet spot(s) for something that is
expressive enough, but small enough to be a no-brainer to use in a new
project.  At least the smallest one should be.

It also serves as a learning JavaScript project for me.  I strongly
follow Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts.
